    <h1>My husky was named Loki.</h1>
    <p>
        I got Loki at the beginning of November of 2014. He was only seven weeks
        old and weighed about six pounds. From the beginning he was a handful to
        say the least. But after a lot of training and patience he because the
        best dog anyone could ask for. He loved running and playing fetch(when he
        was actually in the mood). He destroyed many a things, from shoes, tools
        or furniture. Unfortunately luck wasn't on our side and he developed
        lymphoma and it spread quickly. He passed away towards the end of 2023
        after a short time after diagnosis. While I loved my dog very much, I had
        to let him go. The Siberian husky are an amazing breed, but need many
        people get them to only realize th challenge they bring.
